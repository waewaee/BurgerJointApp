    burgerOne.burgerName = "Chicken Burger"
    burgerOne.burgerDescription = "The hot chicken sandwich or simply \"hot chicken\" (Quebec French: sandwich chaud au poulet) is a type of chicken sandwich consisting of chicken, sliced bread, and gravy (which is generally poutine sauce). The sandwich is usually served with green peas and commonly found in Eastern Canadian cuisine. It's especially popular in Quebec and is often considered one of the province's staple dishes.[7][8] Since it is so commonly found in eateries of Quebec (Rôtisserie St-Hubert, Valentine, e.g.) and less seen outside the province, many Québécois regard it as a part of Quebec cuisine and believe it to have originated in the province.[7] This combination of chicken, gravy, and peas is known by its own term: galvaude,[7] seen in poutine galvaude.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Although less featured in other areas of North America, the sandwich is also found in small diners from the Canadian Maritimes[9] and throughout the Southeastern United States.[10]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The sandwich was a working-class dish already common and well established in North American cuisine by the early 1900s[11] and featured on the food menus of pharmacists and druggists of the time.[12] Due to its ease of preparation and its minimal costs, the sandwich was also widely served in the mess halls and cafeterias of the mid-1900s.[13][14]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This style of sandwich often makes use of leftovers from a previous meal. Substituting turkey for the chicken would make a hot turkey sandwich[15] and substituting roast beef makes a variety of the roast beef sandwich.[16]"

    burgerTwo.burgerName = "Big Mac Burger"
    burgerTwo.burgerDescription = "The Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of DDB Worldwide, and his creative group at Needham Harper and Steers. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a \"Big Mac Attack\".\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In the United States during the original campaign many franchises ran promotions that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns.[citation needed] McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free glass of Coca-Cola instead), in the Portuguese-language version, which is \"Dois hambúrgueres, alface, queijo, molho especial, cebola e picles num pão com gergelim\".\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In 2003, McDonald's revived the phrase. In an English-language ad from McDonald's international \"i'm lovin' it\" campaign, a rapper rapidly spouts off the trademark in the background music. Also in 2003, American Greetings and Carlton Cards released a Christmas ornament of a Big Mac, on which the slogan was both printed and played aloud by pulling on a string. Roy Bergold, National Advertising Manager at McDonald's, has a big hand in championing the original campaign and helping to bring it back.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In 2008 McDonald's Malaysia revived the phrase. The revival includes the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer is able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. It was released in May, along with the promotional Mega Mac, which has four beef patties instead of two.[13]"

    burgerThree.burgerName = "Cheese Burger"
    burgerThree.burgerDescription = "By the late 19th century, the opening of the vast grasslands of the Great Plains to cattle ranching had made it possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily. The hamburger was, and remains, one of the cheapest sources of beef in America.[1]\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in the late-1920s to mid-1930s, and there are several competing claims as to who created the first cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1926 at the age of 16 when he was working as a fry cook at his father's Pasadena, California sandwich shop, \"The Rite Spot\", and \"experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger.\"[2][3][4][5][6]\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Other restaurants also claim to have invented the cheeseburger. For example, Kaelin's Restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, said it invented the cheeseburger in 1934.[10] One year later, a trademark for the name \"cheeseburger\" was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver, Colorado.[11] According to Steak 'n Shake archives, the restaurant's founder, Gus Belt, applied for a trademark on the word in the 1930s.[12][13][14]"

            "The patties that are the essence of a veggie burger have existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia, including in the form of disc-shaped grilled or fried meatballs or as koftas, a commonplace item in Indian cuisine. These may contain meats or be made of entirely vegetarian ingredients such as legumes or other plant-derived proteins. While it is not possible, or even necessary, to identify the 'inventor' of the veggie burger, there have been numerous claimants.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The veggie burger, by name, may have been created in London in 1982 by Gregory Sams, who called it the 'VegeBurger'. Gregory and his brother Craig had run a natural food restaurant in Paddington since the 1960s;[1] a Carrefour hypermarket in Southampton sold 2000 packets in three weeks after its launch.[2] An earlier reference can be heard in the June 7th 1948 episode of \"Let George Do It\" called \"The Mister Mirch Case\" where a character refers to \"vegeburgers,\" as a burger made of nuts and legumes.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Using the name Gardenburger, an early veggie burger was developed by Paul Wenner around 1980 or 1981 in Wenner's vegetarian restaurant, The Gardenhouse, in Gresham, Oregon.[3]"
